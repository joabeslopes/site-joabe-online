    <p>
        My name is Joabe Lopes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a musician, fascinated by technology, and i'm always trying to learn new things.
        <br/>
        Since my childhood, i always liked everything that surrounds the digital world, and had an affinity with that.
        <br/>
        But I spent many years putting that interest aside, until a moment when I could no longer let it go, and then I decided to invest my future in this area.
        <br/>
        This time i know i'm on the right way.
