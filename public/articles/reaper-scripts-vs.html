    Reaper scripts in Lua
  </a>

  <div class="side-border">
    <p>
      &emsp; Scripts in Lua language, for automate the creation of multitrack show projects on the Reaper DAW.
      <br/>
      &emsp; This is a very repetitive and time consuming work, so these scripts can fasten this work,
      by creating and coloring multiple tracks at once, reading all the music folders inside the project, and
      insert the audio files on the corresponding track, based on the file name.
      <br/>
      &emsp; I decided to make then public and available for use in <a href="https://reapack.com/">Reapack</a>, 
      an open source Reaper extension that allow the users to download
      scripts, effects, personalized themes and more, all made by the community.
      <br/>
      &emsp; With Reapack installed, just import the link to my repository <a href="https://github.com/joabeslopes/Reaper-scripts-multitrack-show/raw/main/index.xml">index.xml</a> 
        into it, then browse for "Joabe Lopes" and all my scripts will be there, 
        with the instructions for use inside then.
