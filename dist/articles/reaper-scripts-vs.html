      Reaper scripts in Lua
    </a>

        &emsp; 
        Scripts in Lua language for automating the creation of multitrack show projects on the DAW Reaper.
        <br> &emsp;
        This is a very repetitive and time consuming work, so this scripts can advance a good part of the service, by creating and coloring multiple tracks at once, reading all the folders inside the project main folder, and insert the audio files on the correct track, based on the file name.
        <br> &emsp;
        I decided not only to make then public, but also available for use in <a href="https://reapack.com/">Reapack</a>, an open source Reaper extension that allow the users to download scripts, effects, personalized themes and more, all made by the community.
        <br> &emsp;
        With Reapack installed, just import the link to my repository <a href="https://github.com/joabeslopes/Reaper-scripts-multitrack-show/raw/main/index.xml">index.xml</a> into it, then browse for "Joabe Lopes" and all my scripts will be there, with the instructions for use inside then.
