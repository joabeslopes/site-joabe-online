      Email search app in Java

        I developed an desktop app in Java, where the students search for the first name of the teacher, and the app shows his email and other relevant informations, like the id, surname, classes he teaches and it's periods.
        <br> &emsp;
        Furthermore, the app also have a button that copies the selected email, and open a new tab on the browser with the Outlook page, so that the students can send an email to the selected teacher.
        <br> &emsp;
        The app communicates directly with a MySQL database, through the JDBC driver, and send the SQL queries to get the necessary information.
        <br> &emsp;
        It's a simple app, but it was a fun experience that teaches me a lot of things.
