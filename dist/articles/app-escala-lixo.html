      Thrash schedule app
    </a>

    <div class="side-border">
    <p> &emsp;
    In my work, we make a monthly schedule for taking out the thrash from the office, so it doesn't accumulate.
    <br> &emsp;
    Every month, it was requiring a manual effort for organizing this schedule.
    <br> &emsp;
    So i made a python web application for generating this schedule automatically, respecting the days when the employee is not in the office (Home office days).
    <br> &emsp;
    I'm also using this app for studying frontend development, refactoring it using Jquery, vanilla javascript (with and without classes), React, etc.
