        &emsp; Yes, this website here is also open source, and hosted with Github pages.
        <br> 
        &emsp; I got the domain name from <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/"> FreeDNS</a>, a nice project that allows anyone to have 5 free subdomain names.
        You can also have a lot more, if you decide donate to the project.
        <br> 
        &emsp; My plan is to learn a lot more about web development, and apply it to this website, so changes are expected.
