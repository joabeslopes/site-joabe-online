    Git Joabe

    <p>
      &emsp; I implemented my self-hosted "Github".
      <br>
      &emsp; Me and my friend Natan decided to create a game project together, and use git for the source control.
      But a game project requires a lot of images, audios, etc., and this kind of file is much heavier than text files.
      <br>
      &emsp; That's why <a href="https://git-lfs.com/"> Git lfs</a> exists, it can handle large files in a git
      repository, keeping it lightweight.
      <br>
      &emsp; Github already has support for git-lfs, but it comes with a price, so thats why i decided to store my own
      self-hosted code repository, so then me and my friend could have a lot of space available for using git-lfs
      (also, i could have an excuse for implementing new things in my home lab).
      <br>
      &emsp; Then i made my own fork of <a href="https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket">Gitbucket project</a>,
      did a rollback to the 4.39 release, addedd some customization, and implemented in my home server.
      <br>
      &emsp; And that's it.
