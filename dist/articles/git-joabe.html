    Git Joabe

    <p>
      &emsp; I made my self-hosted "Github".
      <br>
      &emsp; Me and my friend Natan decided to create a game project together, and use git for the source control
      (obvious
      choice). But a game project requires a lot of images, audios, etc., and this kind of files are much heavier than
      text files.
      <br>
      &emsp; That's why <a href="https://git-lfs.com/"> Git lfs</a> exists, it can handle large files in a git
      repository,
      keeping the repository lightweight.
      <br>
      &emsp; Github already has support for git-lfs, but it comes with a price, so thats why i decided to store my own
      self-hosted private Github, so then me and my friend could have a lot more free space available for using git-lfs
      (and also i could have an excuse for put new things in my home lab).
      <br>
      &emsp; That's why i made my own fork of <a href="https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket">Gitbucket project</a>.
      Then i
      did a rollback to the 4.39 release on the git history, addedd some customization, and implemented in my home
      server.
      <br>
      &emsp; And that's it.
